# Implementation Summary: Complete Mediation System with AI Valuation

## What We've Implemented

### 1. Updated Valuation Weights (California PI Standards)
**Files Modified:**
- `src/valuation/weights.json`
- `src/valuation/calcEvaluatorAI.ts`
- `src/valuation/deductionEngine.ts`

**Changes:**
- **Injections**: $50,000 each (California standard)
- **Major Surgeries**: $250,000 per level (fusion, disc replacement)
- **Minor Surgeries**: $75,000-$150,000 (micro decompression, arthroscopy)
- **Multi-level Detection**: Automatically detects "2-level fusion" and multiplies appropriately
- **Subsequent Accident Deductions**: 30-35% for apportionment issues (higher if before surgery)
- **Policy Limit Handling**: 
  - Cases capped at policy limits (most plaintiffs won't seek beyond)
  - Excess risk warnings when value exceeds limits
  - Plaintiff confirmation flag when personal contribution would be needed
  - Defense alerts for bad faith exposure

### 2. ElevenLabs Agent Configuration (Updated)
**Files Modified:**
- `ELEVENLABS_AGENT_CONFIG.md`

**Key Features:**
- **California Law Integration**: References Vehicle Code, CCP, CACI, Evidence Code, Howell, Sargon
- **Hard Conversations**: AI probes weaknesses and challenges unrealistic positions
- **Professional Tone**: Peer-to-peer with experienced attorneys/adjusters
- **Session Closing**: Tells party "valuation report will be emailed within 72 hours"
- **Valuation Guidance Built-In**: AI knows CA standards ($50k injections, $250k surgeries, etc.)

**Tools Available to Agent:**
1. Query similar cases from SQL database
2. Access uploaded briefs and documents
3. Retrieve prior clarification answers
4. Access current case evaluation data

### 3. DOCX Report Generation System
**New Files Created:**
- `supabase/functions/generate-valuation-report/index.ts`

**Features:**
- Extracts case data from brief and clarification answers
- Calls `calcEvaluatorAI` for AI-powered valuation
- Generates comprehensive DOCX report including:
  - Case summary and parties
  - Injuries and treatment details
  - Damages breakdown
  - AI valuation with confidence scores
  - Deductions applied with explanations
  - Comparable cases cited
  - Policy limit analysis and excess risk warnings
  - California law considerations
  - Clarification Q&A
  - Next steps

**Report Storage:**
- Uploaded to Supabase Storage bucket `briefs/`
- Downloadable via secure URL
- Editable DOCX format

### 4. Valuation Request System
**New Files Created:**
- `supabase/functions/request-valuation-report/index.ts`

**Flow:**
1. User ends ElevenLabs voice session
2. System triggers valuation report request
3. Report generated in background
4. User notified: "Your detailed valuation report will be emailed within 72 hours"

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/ElevenLabsSessionRoom.tsx` - Added auto-trigger on session end

### 5. Configuration Updates
**Files Modified:**
- `supabase/config.toml` - Added new edge functions

**New Edge Functions:**
- `generate-valuation-report` - Generates DOCX report with AI valuation
- `request-valuation-report` - Queues/triggers report generation

## Complete Workflow

### For Plaintiff or Defense Counsel:

1. **Upload Brief**
   - Party uploads mediation brief/demand via web interface
   - Brief stored in Supabase Storage
   - Text extracted and embedded for AI access

2. **Start Voice Session**
   - Click "Start Session" in ElevenLabs room
   - AI (Verdict AI) greets party professionally
   - AI acknowledges uploaded brief and summarizes key points

3. **AI Discussion**
   - AI asks targeted strategic questions
   - References California law (Vehicle Code, CCP, etc.)
   - Queries SQL database for similar cases
   - Has HARD conversations about strengths/weaknesses
   - Probes about values, damages, liability, causation
   - Discusses apportionment if subsequent accidents
   - Reviews policy limit considerations

4. **Session Closing**
   - When party indicates they're done
   - AI confirms position and key facts
   - AI says: "Thank you for walking through this case with me. Based on our discussion, I'll prepare a detailed written valuation report that will be emailed to you within 72 hours."

5. **End Session**
   - Party clicks "End Session"
   - Toast notification: "Your detailed valuation report will be emailed within 72 hours"
   - System auto-triggers valuation report generation

6. **Backend Valuation**
   - System extracts all case data from brief + conversation
   - Runs SQL lookup for similar cases
   - Runs `calcEvaluatorAI` with updated weights:
     - $50k per injection
     - $250k per major surgery level
     - $75k-$150k minor surgeries
     - 30-35% deduction for subsequent accidents
   - Applies all deductions and boosts
   - Checks policy limits and flags excess risk
   - Generates comprehensive DOCX report

7. **Report Delivery**
   - Report uploaded to Supabase Storage
   - Admin can download and edit DOCX
   - Report emailed to party within 72 hours (manual for now)

## Example Case Flow

**Case**: Rear-end collision, plaintiff had cervical fusion after accident, then minor fender-bender 3 months later before surgery, 4 epidural injections, $100k medical specials, $250k policy limits

**AI Conversation Highlights:**
- AI: "I see the rear-end collision and cervical fusion. When did the subsequent accident occur?"
- Party: "About 3 months after the first accident, before the surgery"
- AI: "That creates significant apportionment issues under California law. How do you plan to handle the causation argument?"
- [Discussion continues about liability, Howell reductions, etc.]

**Valuation Calculation:**
- Base value from SQL comparables: $180,000
- Surgery boost: +$250,000 (1-level fusion)
- Injection boost: +$200,000 (4 × $50k)
- **Subtotal: $630,000**
- Subsequent accident before surgery deduction: -35% (-$220,500)
- Other deductions: -10% (treatment gap)
- **Net Value: $347,175**
- Mediator proposal: 95% = $329,816 (rounded to $330,000)
- **Within policy limits ✓**

**Report Sections:**
- Case Summary
- AI Valuation: $330,000
- Settlement Range: $313,500 - $346,500
- Confidence: 78%
- Deductions: Subsequent accident (35%), Treatment gap (10%)
- Comparable Cases: #4521, #3982, #7234
- **California Law Analysis**: CCP § 1431.2 (pure comparative negligence), apportionment standards, causation burden
- Policy Limit Analysis: Within limits, no excess risk
- Recommendation: Settlement range reasonable given apportionment issues
